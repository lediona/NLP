Buiding an Entity Resolution (ER) system that identifies duplicated organization entities and assign a unique id to each organization name.

The output of the code produces a result as follows:

name,id
MLS MULTINATION LOGISTIC SERVICES,AB3CJX
LEICA CANADA,B1DGJC
MLS MULTINATIONAL LOGISTIC SERVICES,AB3CJX

The core of this system entails using double_metaphone algorithm that given  an entity returns characters key, which are a phonetic translation of the passed in wordphonetic key generator methods.

In the jupyter notebook are performed the following steps:
- read the dataset and perform the normalization , cleaning and sorting 
- Find for each entities the phonetic tuples from the methaphone algorithm 
- Filter the entities based on the tuples, if the tuple are equivalent then extract the entities
- the extracted entities are provided with an ID, that represents the first item of the tuple.
